# WebApp Prototype: Stable Diffusion Model API with Chakra UI


This repository contains a web application prototype that utilizes a Stable Diffusion Model API, built on Python and pretrained model from HuggingFace, combined with a sample web app created with the Chakra UI template. The Stable Diffusion Model API allows users to generate stable and high-quality samples based on the provided input.

## Features

- Utilizes a pretrained Stable Diffusion Model from Hugging Face.
- Interactive web interface built with the Chakra UI template.
- Generate stable and high-quality samples from the provided input (the output is stored locally0
- Easy-to-use interface for user input and result display. (under development)

## Dependencies

To run this web application prototype, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask (web framework)
- Hugging Face Transformers (for utilizing the Stable Diffusion Model API)
- Chakra UI (for the web app interface)


Acknowledgements
- The Stable Diffusion Model API is built on the pretrained model from Hugging Face. More details on the model and usage can be found in their documentation.
- The Chakra UI template provides the foundation for the web app prototype. Further information and customization options can be found in the Chakra UI documentation.
